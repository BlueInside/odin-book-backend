# Social Media Platform Clone

## Overview
This project is part of my curriculum at [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/), specifically within the Full Stack JavaScript path. The goal is to build a clone of a social media platform to demonstrate and solidify my skills in full-stack development.

### Objective
The primary objective of this project is to create a functional social media application similar to platforms like Facebook or Twitter. This involves implementing features such as user authentication, posts, likes, comments, and a follow system. The project is intended to be a comprehensive exercise to apply practical web development techniques covering both front-end and back-end development.

## Technologies Used
- **Backend:**
  - **Node.js:** A JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine.
  - **Express:** A minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework that provides a robust set of features to develop web and mobile applications.
  - **MongoDB:** A NoSQL database used to store application data.
  - **Mongoose:** An ODM (Object Data Modeling) library for MongoDB and Node.js.
  - **PassportJS:** Authentication middleware for Node.js, handling user authentication in various ways.

- **Frontend:**
  - **React:** A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
  - **Styled Components:** Utilized for styling within the React components, allowing for scoped CSS and dynamic styling.

- **Tools and Other Technologies:**
  - **Git:** For version control.
  - **Heroku:** A platform as a service (PaaS) that enables developers to build, run, and operate applications entirely in the cloud.

## Key Learning Outcomes
Through completing this project, I expect to gain or improve the following skills:
- **Full-Stack Development:** Integrating both front-end and back-end technologies to create a seamless and functional application.
- **RESTful API Design:** Designing and implementing a well-structured RESTful API using Express.
- **Database Management:** Handling complex data relationships using MongoDB and enhancing performance with proper indexing and data retrieval strategies.
- **Authentication and Security:** Implementing secure authentication systems and understanding common security concerns in web applications.
- **React Development:** Enhancing my React skills, particularly in managing state across the application, routing, and using advanced patterns in real-world scenarios.
- **Responsive Design:** Building a responsive front-end that looks good on both desktop and mobile devices.
